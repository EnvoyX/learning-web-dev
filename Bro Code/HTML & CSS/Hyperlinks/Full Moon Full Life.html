        [Verse 1: Azumi Takahashi] <br>
        It's full moon again <br>
        Crazy how time flies <br>
        One might wonder <br>
        If my path was in a right direction <br>
        But I do believe <br>
        Things come to life by accident <br>
        When it remains on <br>
        Sounds like it's meant to be <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        [Pre-Chorus: Lotus Juice] <br>
        (Wake up) New space made when things fall apart <br>
        (Get up) What matters after ending's how you left a mark <br>
        (Don't wait up) Fire in my soul, fire in my heart <br>
        'Til you see me on the other side of stars, I'm running <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        [Chorus: Azumi Takahashi, Lotus Juice] <br>
        All the journeys start some where with a first step <br>
        No one's sure what lies ahead, be bold and brave (Stand up) <br>
        Roads may be rough and tough <br>
        Though it will lead some where (Nothing easy, get up and go, get it, go) <br>
        Sometimes it's journey itself that teaches <br>
        A lot about the destination not aware of <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        [Post-Chorus: Azumi Takahashi, Lotus Juice] <br>
        No matter how far (No matter how far) <br>
        How you go (How you go, how you go) <br>
        How long it may last (Carpe Diem, no time to waste) <br>
        Venture life, burn your dread (You gotta venture life, go get it, burn your dread) <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        [Verse 2: Azumi Takahashi] <br>
        When there's a beginning <br>
        There's an ending too <br>
        As we go we come across many predicaments <br>
        Delight lies beneath <br>
        Colors of life that's excellent <br>
        Though pictures fade away <br>
        Beauty will remain the same <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        [Pre-Chorus: Lotus Juice] <br>
        (Go) Stop living dead when your heart's beating still <br>
        (Hope) No slowing down for me, I'm never gonna chill <br>
        (Go) Every low phase, I ride it like a drill <br>
        I'll abide by the rules, but outshine and prove <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        [Chorus: Azumi Takahashi, Lotus Juice] <br>
        Only time will tell the magnitude of deeds <br>
        Longer we wait may it be the sweeter kiss (Or will it? Only time will tell) <br>
        Standing by for answers <br>
        Shall it ease the pain (Nothing easy, get up and go, get it, go) <br>
        Only from the heart one reaches to the sky <br>
        Ups and downs they go, so hands up and enjoy the ride <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        [Post-Chorus: Azumi Takahashi, Lotus Juice] <br>
        As you go (As you go) <br>
        Believe in (Believe in) <br>
        The faith and yourself (Carpe Diem, no time to waste) <br>
        Venture with no regret (You gotta venture life, go get it, no regret)<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        [Bridge: Azumi Takahashi] <br>
        Choices one makes reflect hope and fear <br>
        Be brave, endure the pain <br>
        Then one might just gain <br>
        The strength one sought <br>
        Which may be hearts and souls of life <br>
        Meanings all of us search for <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        [Verse 3: Lotus Juice] <br>
        Question, no answers <br>
        Will this be for nothing? <br>
        I felt so so worthless, and nervous, disgusted <br>
        I would be so broken, unless I conducted <br>
        Diligently, patiently, and trusted myself <br>
        Nothing was given to me so gonna go earn it <br>
        Every pain is another motivation, I burn it <br>
        Trepidation doesn't stop death but it stops life <br>
        Accepting open minds for lights <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        [Chorus: Azumi Takahashi, Lotus Juice] <br>
        One day these quiet voices will be heard <br>
        Loud and clear, the story of the ones we miss (Stand up) <br>
        But shed no tears <br>
        Realize what they left behind (Nothing easy, get up and go, get it, go) <br>
        Explore within the limits of the time <br>
        No one should need a permit to a way of life <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        [Post-Chorus: Azumi Takahashi, Lotus Juice] <br>
        No matter how far (No matter how far) <br>
        How you go (How you go, how you go) <br>
        How short it may last (Carpe Diem, no time to waste) <br>
        Venture life, burn your dread (You gotta venture life, go get it, burn your dread) <br>
